# `collider`

accelerationist-compass future generator

Eventually would be cool to make this create an endless field of such futures, but need to figure out how to source images first

## Usage

First, edit terms in `terms.txt`. The basic format is:

```
# pattern_name
value a
value {sub_pattern}

# sub_pattern
b
c
```

This yields `value a`, `value b`, or `value c`.

See `terms.txt` for a more comprehensive example. Feel free to open a PR to add more terms!

Then run `python main.py`

## Example Output

```
anarcho-automated union-owned eden
platform labor revolution
platform worker utopia
toxic automation corporatism
survivalist war kingdoms
hypo-commodified union-free colonies
hypo-colonial protest democracy
neo-agrarian time patchwork
anti-platform soul colonies
post-financial welfare-owned colonies
```
